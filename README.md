Base Atomic CSS     
=============================

This is the start of the Base Atomic CSS for rapid prototyping. The idea behind this project is to provide a base set of utility classes that can be eaisily added to a new or existing project. It is designed to be modular so if you dont use a set of utility classes remove it from the import statement on the _utility-dir.scss file. 


This is a starter file that inludes: 
1. Jekyll 
2. Gulp
    Browser sync 
    Autoprefix
    Pug 
3. Atomic utlility classes
